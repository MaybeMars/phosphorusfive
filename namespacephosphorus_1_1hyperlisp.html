<div class="textblock"><p>Main namespace for parsing and creating Hyperlisp. </p>
<p>Encapsulates all classes and Active Event necessary to create and parse Hyperlisp.</p>
<p>Hyperlisp is the <em>"syntax"</em> that allows you to create pf.lambda execution trees using a textual-based format. Hyperlisp is in fact the only place where actual <em>"parsing"</em> is done in Phosphorus.Five, besides from to some extent Expressions though. This trait completely separates Phosphorus.Five and pf.lambda from all other programming languages, since the syntax for describing your <em>"code"</em>, is completely de-coupled from the actual environment that executes that code.</p>
<p>In fact, if you wish, you can easily create your own XML parser, that parses XML documents, for then to execute the parsed documents as pf.lambda. You could probably even <em>"execute"</em> HTML documents if you wish, or JSON, BSON, or any other document format capable of describing relational tree-structures, including EDIFACT for that matter. However, Hyperlisp is our preferred file-format, used when writing <em>"code"</em>, that we transform into our pf.lambda execution trees.</p>
<p>Hyperlisp is similar to JSON, or BSON to be more accurate, since it allows you to describe type-information, in addition to JSON's key/value parts. Hyperlisp does however have one unique trait over BSON, which sets it apart from both of the previously mentioned formats, which is its ability to in addition to being a key/value file-format, also explicitly in addition allows you to describe <em>"children nodes"</em>. For instance, imagine a node with a key of <em>"foo"</em>, value of <em>"bar"</em> and two children. In JSON this would have to be described like this;</p>
<pre>{[{"Name" : "foo", "Value" : "bar", "Children": [
  {
    "Name" : "foo_child_name1", 
    "Value" : "foo_child_value1"
  },
  {
    "Name" : "foo_child_name2", 
    "Value" : "foo_child_value2"
  }
]}]}</pre><p>The above piece of JSON is a LOT of syntax, for very little effect. In Hyperlisp the same structure can be described with this code;</p>
<pre>foo:bar
  foo_child_name1:foo_child_value1
  foo_child_name2:foo_child_value2
</pre><p>We effectively reduced 9 lines of JSON to three lines of Hyperlisp, and while doing so, we reduced the number of control characters from 50 to 3! In addition, if we wanted to communicate that one of our values was not a <em>"string"</em> type, but an integer, we could easily do so by creating a piece of code, resembling something like this;</p>
<pre>foo:bar
  foo_child_name1:foo_child_value1
  foo_child_INTEGER:<b>int</b>:5
</pre><p>The above traits with Hyperlisp, makes it superior to describing relational key/value/children tree structures for us, which is why we use our own invention which we call "Hyperlisp", instead of using an existing file-format, such as JSON or XML.</p>
<p><em>"One has to be a complete idiot, to not be able to see that there exists better file-formats, for describing relational 
    tree-structures, than that of JSON"</em> - Douglas Crockford quote, freely re-written ... ;)</p>
<p>The basic structure of Hyperlisp is that it starts with a "key", then there's a colon, followed by the "value". If you have a type, other than string, you'll need to put the type between the "key" and "value". Beneath the node itself, you can describe the node's children nodes, by prepending the names of the children with two spaces ("&#160;&#160;").</p>
<p>The type-system of Hyperlisp is also extendible, which means that you can create your own types, and create support for your own types in Hyperlisp, which you can find examples of in the <a class="el" href="namespacephosphorus_1_1types.html" title="Main namespace for types and type-conversions in Phosphorus.Five. ">phosphorus.types</a> project. As long as you can somehow represent your types with a string, you can represent your types in Hyperlisp.</p>
<p>Hyperlisp recognizes strings the same way C# does, which means you can create single-line string literals like this;</p>
<pre>foo:"this is a single\nline \"string\""</pre><p>And you can create multi-line strings like this;</p>
<pre>foo:@"this is a
multi line string"</pre><p>Both the name of a node, and its value, can be represented using both single-line string literals, and multi-line string literals. Only the value of a node can have a type associated with it though.</p>
<p>To create a comment in Hyperlisp, is similar to creating comments in C#, except for the fact, that a comment cannot appear in any ways on the same line as a semantic key/value portion of your Hyperlisp. Comments are completely ignored, and will not in any ways become a part of your pf.lambda structure. This is done to make sure you can comment your code, without running the risk that your comment starts adding to your bandwidth usage when transmitting pf.lambda code over the wire, using for instance HTTP. Below is an example of a single-line comment.</p>
<pre>// Single line comment
foo:bar
// Another single line comment</pre><p>Whitespace characters, are as a general rule ignored, except in front of the "name" portion. When you declare children nodes of a node, you do so by putting the child node on a line underneath the node it is supposed to be a child node of, and add two additional spaces in front of the name. This means that if the name of your node, starts with a whitespace character, then you must put the name of your node inside some sort of string literal. Consider this;</p>
<pre>foo:bar
  " foo2 ":"&#160;&#160;&#160;White spaces are NOT ignored here!&#160;&#160;&#160;"
  foo3&#160;&#160;&#160;:&#160;&#160;&#160;While this value, and name, is basically 'trimmed' ...&#160;&#160;&#160;
 &#160;&#160;
    // The line above this line, and below, is completely ignored by the Hyperlisp parser
 &#160;&#160;
    foo4:While this is actually a child of the 'foo3' node!</pre><p>By using multi-line string literals as the names of your nodes, it is very much possible to almost completely destroy the readability of your Hyperlisp, therefor we suggest that you use the names portion of your nodes, mostly for things that don't require carriage returns, or white-space characters in the beginning or end of your names.</p>
<p>You can also nest string literals inside of each other, consider the following code;</p>
<pre>_hyperlisp:node:@"_data
  foo:@""Multi line
string literal, which is a part of
a reference node"""</pre><p>If you nest too many levels of string literals inside string literals, then obviously your code will rapidly become completely impossible to understand, so be careful with these features of the language.</p>
<p>The rules for string literals, are the exact same rules as for C#. You can use any of the escape characters you're used to from C# in single-line string literals. Multi-line string literals also works identical to how they work in C#.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a deep hierarchy of nodes, some of these nodes contains Hyperlisp syntactic errors though;</p>
<pre>_root1
  foo1:bar1
    foo2:I am a child of foo1
    foo3:I am also a child of foo1
      foo4:While I am a child of foo3
    foo5:While I am a child of foo1 again
_root2:I am another root node
   foo6:I am a 'syntax error', with three spaces in front of my name. To fix me, remove one space!
_root2:Same name as my 'elder brother', which is perfectly valid Hyperlisp!
    foo7:@"I am a 'syntax error', I apparently seem to be the grandchild of _root2, 
without any children of _root2 existing. To 'fix me', remove two of the spaces in front of my 'name' portion!"
_root3:I am a syntax error, since I contain a ':' character inside of my value! To fix me, double-quote me!</pre><p>Hyperlisp is not a replacement for neither JSON nor BSON, and in fact, Phosphorus.Ajax uses for instance JSON as its Ajax transport mechanism, when returning values from the server. But for declaring key/value/children tree-structures on the server-side, it is very much superior to both JSON and XML. First of all, since it significantly reduces the size of its files compared to both JSON and XML. Secondly, because it provides much more intuitive and easily understood syntax. Thirdly, because it provides an extendible type mechanism, allowing you to store type-information together with your data.</p>
<p>When returning objects from your server to a web-browser client, you should probably stay with JSON, but when sending values between servers, and storing pf.lambda execution trees, then Hyperlisp is superior in all ways. This can be seen by the fact that the <a class="el" href="namespacephosphorus_1_1data.html" title="Main namespace for all [pd.data.xxx] Active Events. ">phosphorus.data</a> database, in its entirety, uses Hyperlisp as its file format. Hyperlisp is also probably superior in all ways compared to XML when it comes to the concept of web-services, and sending data back and forth between what you'd normally use an XML Web Service for. Among other things, because of its significantly smaller size, than that of XML.</p>
 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yptjGVYOhu4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Hyperlisp is also extremely convenient when it comes to storing pf.lambda objects in files on disc. To load a Hyperlisp file, transform it to pf.lambda, for then to execute the transformed pf.lambda object, can be done with three lines of code;</p>
<pre>pf.file.load:foo.hl
pf.hyperlisp.hyperlisp2lambda:@/-/0?value
lambda.copy:@/-?node</pre> </div></div><!-- contents -->
