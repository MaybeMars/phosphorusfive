///     Main namespace for all pf.lambda Expression Iterators.
/// 
///     A pf.lambda Expression Iterator is an sub-part of a pf.lambda expression, which informs the expression engine what types
///     of criteria the nodes from the previous iterator, if any, the nodes should match, in order to become a part of the result
///     for the next iterator.
/// 
///     An iterator starts with a slash (/), and can optionally end with a slash. The iterator's content, can optionally be put
///     inside of double-quotes ("), if you have complex characters, that are normally considered control characters in the expression
///     engine.
/// 
///     You can also compose multi-line string iterators, by putting your iterator's content inside of @"xxx" as a multi-line string literal.
