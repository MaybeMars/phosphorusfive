/// <summary>
///     Contains all the main widgets in Phosphorus.Ajax.
/// 
///     The widgets that Phosphorus.Ajax is composed out of, can be found in this namespace.
/// 
///     * Literal - Allows you to create widgets that contains simple text or HTML values.
///     * Container - A widget that can contain children widgets of its own.
///     * Void - Useful for creating widgets that has neither children widgets, nor any inner HTML. HTML input elements are one example.
///     * Widget - Base class with common functionality for all widgets.
/// 
///     However, since you can override any property, and add any attribute you wish, to any of the above widgets, these widgets are actually
///     enough to be able to create any HTML markup you wish. If you wish to create a container widget, that renders like an HTML address element,
///     then all you have to do, as to set the <em>"ElementType"</em> property of your widget to "address".
/// 
///     If you wish to handle the <em>"onmouseover"</em> DOM event on the server-side, then all you need to do, is to provide an "onmouseover" attribute,
///     referencing the event handler from your codebehind, and voila; You're in <em>"server-land"</em>, whenever anyone hovers their mouse over your
///     HTML element.
/// 
///     Phosphorus.Ajax will automatically understand the difference between a server-side Event Handler, and a JavaScript DOM client-side
///     event. If you supply something that is not a legal C# or VB.NET method name as the value of any attribute starting with the text "on" in your
///     widgets, then Phosphorus.Ajax will assume you've supplied a JavaScript DOM event handler, and simply render your widget's attribute, as a 
///     client-side JavaScript piece of code, to be executed when DOM event bubbles up.
/// 
///     Below is some sample code of how to create an Hello World application in C# using Phosphorus.Ajax;
