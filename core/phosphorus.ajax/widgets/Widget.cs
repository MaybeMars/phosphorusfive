    ///     properties of widgets automatically during Ajax requests.
    /// 
    ///     All changes to your widgets will be automatically rendered back to client as JSON, and only the changes will be sent. This means
    ///     that Phosphorus.Ajax consumes very little bandwidth. This fact combined with the fact that Phosphorus.Ajax only contains ~5KB of
    ///     JavaScript in release builds, makes your websites extremely small and responsive.
    /// 
    ///     This class automatically maps up all properties and attributes of your widgets, and also automatically creates Ajax server-side event
    ///     handlers for your DOM events, and sends back the changes to the client when you're done handling your HTTP postbacks and requests.
    /// 
    ///     This widget can render any HTML you wish, and dynamically change, set, or remove, any attributes and/or server-side Ajax Events you 
    ///     wish, in addition to have your client-side JavaScript DOM events automatically mapped for you.
    /// 
    ///     Basically; You get to create your code exclusively in C#, and this class maps your C# to JavaScript and client-side logic for you. Though,
    ///     if you wish, you can of course combine widgets created through this class, with any amounts of client-side logic, and JavaScript you wish.
