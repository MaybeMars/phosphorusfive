                <h1>phosphorus ajax examples</h1>

                <p>
                    these are the examples for phosphorus.ajax, for those who wants to directly consume the ajax library in phosphorus,
                    using traditional development in C#, using ASP.NET and web forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;the examples for phosphorus.ajax, can 
                    either be read sequentially, as a book, or you can use them as a reference guide.&nbsp;&nbsp;however, phosphorus.ajax
                    contains only three widgets, and less than 5KB of JavaScript, so teaching yourself pf.ajax, should easily be done in
                    minutes

                <h2>hello world</h2>

                <p>
                    <pf:Literal
                        runat="server"
                        id="hello"
                        ElementType="strong"
                        RenderType="normal"
                        onclick="hello_onclick">click me for hello world</pf:Literal>

                <p>
                    you can change the element rendered through the <em>"ElementType"</em> property, and the rendering type through
                    <em>"RenderType"</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;you can set any event handler or attribute you wish, by adding them directly
                    in markup, or using the index operator overload in your codebehind.&nbsp;&nbsp;for security reasons, all event handlers
                    must be marked with the <em>"WebMethod"</em> attribute.&nbsp;&nbsp;please notice, using your browser, how only changes
                    are returned from the server
