    ///     Class wrapping conditional statements.
    /// 
    ///     This class is used in for instance [while], [if] and [else-if], and wraps the conditions used to
    ///     figure out if statement yields true or not.
    /// 
    ///     There exists 8 basic types of conditions, and they're all defined through their <em>"operators"<em/>, or lack of operator.
    ///     These 8 types of conditions are;
    /// 
    ///     1. = is the equals operator.
    ///     2. != is the not-equals operator.
    ///     3. &gt; is the more-than operator.
    ///     4. &lt; is the less-than operator.
    ///     5. &gt;= is the more-than-or-equals operator.
    ///     6. &lt;= is the less-than-or-equals operator.
    ///     7. ! is the not operator.
    ///     8. Exists, has no operator, and is the default condition, if no operator exists.
    /// 
    ///     A condition is normally created through some Active Event reference, such as the [if] Active Event, for then to have a
    ///     value being checked, using <see cref="phosphorus.expressions.Expression">Expressions</see>, according to its 
    ///     condition in its main node. For instance, to check if a node exists, you might do something
    ///     like this;
    /// 
    ///     <pre>if:@/../5?node</pre>
    /// 
    ///     The above example will create an exists condition, and yield true if there are 6 or more nodes beneath the root node of your tree, since
    ///     it is checking for the existence of your 5th node, which is really your 6th of course. Below is an example of how to check if a value
    ///     of one node equals the constant of "foo";
    /// 
    ///     <pre>if:@/../0?value
    ///   =:foo
    ///   lambda
    ///     do-something-here</pre>
    /// 
    ///     The last example above, shows a crucial point, which is that if your condition is a complex compound condition, and not a simple exists
    ///     condition, then you have to create a [lambda.xxx] node beneath it, where you put your pf.lambda code to be executed if condition yields
    ///     true. If your condition is a simple exists condition, you do not need to create a [lambda.xxx] child for your condition, since then
    ///     by default, everything beneath your condition node will be executed using the [lambda] Active Event.
    /// 
    ///     You can also nest conditions, and create and and/or or conditions, which are to be checked in addition to your rot condition. For 
    ///     instance, to check if a node has a specific name, and a specific value, you might do something like this;
    /// 
    ///     <pre>if:@/../0?name
    ///   =:foo
    ///   and:@/../0?value
    ///     =:bar
    ///   lambda
    ///     do-stuff</pre>
    /// 
    ///     You can also create the equivalent of what you'd normally use parenthesis for when creating conditional statements in traditional 
    ///     programming languages, by grouping your conditions inside of each other. The next example would for instance yield true, and 
    ///     execute its child [lambda] node, even though the [and] condition yields false. This is because the first [or] child of our 
    ///     [if] node will evaluated to true, in addition to its inner [and] condition.
    /// 
    ///     <pre>_foo:bar
    ///   foo:bar
    /// if:@/-?name
    ///   =:_foo
    ///   and:@/./-?value
    ///     =:foo
    ///   or:@/./-?value
    ///     =:bar
    ///     and:@/././-?name
    ///       =:_foo
    ///       or:@/./././-?name
    ///         =:_foo2
    ///         and:@/././././-/0?value
    ///   lambda
    ///     do-stuff</pre>
    /// 
    ///     If you change the name of the [_foo] node to [_foo2], the condition will still yield true, but then it will have to check the deepest 
    ///     levels of is parts, and won't yield true, before entering the last [or] statement, which in itself has a nested [and]. If you
    ///     change the name of [_foo] to [_foo2], in addition to removing the [foo] node, who's value is bar, then your condition will not 
    ///     yield true, because then your last <em>"exists condition"</em> will not yield true, which is a pre-requisite for your last [or] to be true.
    /// 
    ///     BTW, for the record; The above piece of code, is a ridiculously complex conditional statement, and something you'd very rarely, if
    ///     ever, actually encounter. Partially because in pf.lambda, you can largely avoid conditions completely, due to pf.lambda's richness in
    ///     its pf.lambda expressions, which will often completely eliminate the need for conditional statements.
    /// 
    ///     You can also of course compare the results of two expressions against each other, such as for instance;
    /// 
    ///     <pre>_source1
    ///   foo1:su
    ///   foo2:cc
    ///   foo3:ess
    /// _source2:success
    /// if:@/-?value
    ///   =:@/./-2/"*"?value
    ///   lambda
    ///     do-stuff</pre>
    /// 
    ///     In the above condition, the first expression will create a single result out of all the values of the children of the [_source1] node,
    ///     for then to compare that single result against the result of the second expression, which returns the value of [_source2]. Since they
    ///     both yield <em>"success"</em>, the condition will evaluate to true, and pf.lambda code inside the [lambda] node will be executed.
    /// 
    ///     Instead of using [lambda], you can also use any other [lambda.xxx] Active Events you wish, as the nodes to be executed when 
    ///     your expressions yields true. You can also use [lambda.copy], [lambda.immutable], [lambda.single], or for that matter [lambda.fork] 
    ///     if you wish. Any Active Event starting with the text <em>"lambda"</em>, can be used as the conditional pf.lambda code to execute 
    ///     upon success of evaluation of your conditions. For instance, consider this code, evaluating two integers, to see if one of them is larger
    ///     than the other, and if so, invokes a [lambda.single] statement.
