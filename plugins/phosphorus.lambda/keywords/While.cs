        ///     result-set, [while] loops as long as some <see cref="phosphorus.lambda.keywords.helpers.Conditions">Condition</see> is true.

        ///     Example;
        /// 
        ///     <pre>_data
        ///   foo1:bar1

        ///     Since [while] will loop for as long as a condition is true, it is easy to create a never-ending loop, that will lock the current
        ///     execution thread, creating a "dead-lock" in your pf.lambda code. To avoid such dead-locks, you must makke sure that your condition
        ///     at some point yields false. Just like the [if] keyword, the [while] keyword must have explicit [lambda.xxx] objects beneath itself,
        ///     unless your [while] condition is a "simple exists" condition. For instance;
        /// 
        ///     <pre>_data
        ///   foo1:bar1
        ///   foo2:bar2
