/// <summary>
///     Main namespace for pf.lambda keywords.
/// 
///     Contains all the keywords in pf.lambda, such as [while], [for-each] and [lambda]. pf.lambda is a graph object transformation programming
///     <em>"language"</em>, which means it allows you to modify and transform tree-structures, and execute these as execution trees. pf.lambda
///     is based upon Active Events, which is a design pattern that allows you to dynamically tie together statically created programming modules,
///     created for instance in C#, such as is the case with pf.lambda. Below is an example of a simple pf.lambda program;
/// 
///     <pre>_foo
///   bar1:x
///   bar2:y
/// _dest
/// set:@/-?value
///   source:@/./-2/"*"?value</pre>
/// 
///     The above program, simply transforms the values of all nodes beneath the [_foo] node, and creates a single string value from them.
/// 
///     pf.lambda is not a <em>"general purpose"</em> programming language, but should rather be though of as an <em>"orchestration programming
///     language"</em>, allowing you to loosely tie together existing functionality, in a dynamic programming environment. This just happens to
///     be one of the largest problems in today's world of System Development and System Architecture. However, to illustrate the point that you 
///     cannot use pf.lambda for all your concerns, realize that pf.lamba cannot even add two numbers. If you tried to add 2+2 in pf.lambda, it would
///     actually yield the result of <em>"22"</em>.
/// 
///     When it comes to <em>"orchestrating"</em> your application together though, pf.lambda is probably a superior choice, since it allows you
///     to very loosely couple together existing functionality, from different modules, without bringing in any dependencies between your modules, 
///     what-so-ever. This trait of pf.lambda, is the reasons why we say that pf.lambda <em>"enables Agile Programming"</em>.
/// 
///     pf.lambda is your <em>"front-end programming language"</em> you might say, because it allows you to <em>"tie together"</em> functionality
///     written in other languages, within a very loosely coupled architecture. Phosphorus.Five contains Active Events for a lot of the tasks you'd normally
///     need to write your own plugins for though, which means that you actually very seldom need to resort to C# or VB.NET to extend your 
///     Phosphorus.Five installation. When you do however, you will fast recognize, that the Active Event design pattern, gives you a superior
///     bridge between pf.lambda and C#.
/// 
///     In fact, if you study pf.lambda, and its implementation, you will recognize that pf.lambda <em>"hardly exists"</em>, since it's really
///     nothing but loosely coupled Active Events in itself. For instance the [for-each] keyword, or the [if] keyword in pf.lambda, are actually
///     Active Events, that knows nothing about each other. This allows you to easily extend pf.lambda with your own keywords, as you see fit.
/// 
///     And in fact, there are no semantic differences between any Active Event, such as [pf.file.load], and a <em>"keyword"</em> in pf.lambda.

        ///   set:@/.?value
        ///     source:Hello {0}

        /// lambda:@/-|/-2?node
        ///   _input:Thomas</pre>
        /// 
        ///     Anything you submit to [lambda] that is not a node-set, will be converted into a node-set, before executed. Consider the 
        ///     following code;
        /// 
        ///     <pre>lambda:\@"set:@/./""*""/_result/#?name

        ///     :@/./././""*""/_input?value"
        ///   _result:node:
        ///   _input:Thomas Hansen</pre>
        /// 
        ///     The above code might be difficult to understand when you start out with pf.lambda. However, to explain it, it basically passes in
        ///     the [_result] node by reference to the pf.lambda block executed by the [lambda] statement. The [lambda] block itself, will be 
        ///     created from the string, which is the value of the above [lambda] node, converted into a pf.lambda node-set. In addition it 
        ///     passes in the [_input] parameter. Since we are executing our pf.lambda block, which is converted from text above, the only way 
        ///     to return values from that [lambda] block, is to pass in nodes by reference, for then to have the [lambda] block modify the 
        ///     contents of that node, and/or node hierarchy.
        /// 
        ///     A highly useful example of why you'd like to use constructs such as the above, is to realize you can use the above logic to
        ///     load pf.lambda files, for then to pass in arguments to the execution of those pf.lambda files. Consider the following code;
        /// 
        ///     <pre>pf.file.load:some-hyperlisp-file.hl
        /// lambda:@/./0?value
        ///   some-input-parameter:foo
        ///   some-return-value:node:</pre>
        /// 
        ///     The above construct allows you to perceive files as <em>"functions"</em>, and pass in and return arguments to and from these files.
        ///     This is a pattern often used when you use pf.lambda and Phosphorus.Five. In fact, that's where the name pf.lambda comes from, since
        ///     in pf.lambda, everything is a potential executable piece of <em>"code"</em>.
        /// 
        ///     Another highly useful trait of constructs such as the above, is that you can pass code across HTTP requests, and boundaries where
