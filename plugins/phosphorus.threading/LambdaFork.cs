        ///     as when downloading multiple files over HTTP, where you do not want to wait for the file(s) to be downloaded, before continuing
        ///     the execution of your main thread.
        /// 
        ///     [lambda.fork] works roughly the same way as [lambda.copy], since it executes the thread on a copied instance of its own
        ///     execution tree, except of course that [lambda.fork] creates a new thread, where it executes its code.
        /// 
        ///     If [lambda.fork] has a <see cref="phosphorus.threading.Wait.lambda_wait">[wait]</see> node as its parent, then the [wait] node will 
        ///     be passed in by reference, allowing your thread to return values to the main thread during its execution. If you access any shared 
        ///     objects inside of your thread, you will want to make sure you use a [lock] statement as you do, since otherwise you might up having 
        ///     race conditions towards your shared object.
        ///

        ///     The above piece of code, forks two new threads, downloading the HTML from google.com and digg.com. If you execute the above code, you will
        ///     notice that your pf.lambda code returns immediately, without waiting for the pages to be downloaded. This is because the above threads are
        ///     created as <em>"fire-and-forget"</em> threads, where the caller does not care about waiting for the threads to finish their work.
        ///
