        ///     having expressions not working, since the nodes they're iterating, are changing in the middle of an expression, and so on. Use [lock]
        ///     to avoid this, whenever you're accessing a shared resource from inside your threads.

        ///     to finish what they're doing, before it can move onwards. By using multiple threads like we did above, this process is often significantly
