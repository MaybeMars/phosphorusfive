        ///     response will also automatically have inner multiparts parsed, which means you can create tree structures, parsed from multipart
        ///     return values. If the response is a multipart response, then each MIME header will be parsed, and returned as child nodes of the 
        ///     specified MIME entity wrapper node. If one MIME entity is a multipart in itself, then all of its children MIME entities will be
        ///     returned inside a [children] node, being a child of the outer multipart MIME entity.
        /// 
        ///     If the response is either 'text/xxx' or anything else, then the entire response will be put into a [content] node, as either text,

        /// 
        ///     If you do not create a multipart request, you can still transfer files to the server end-point, without having to load these files
        ///     into the memory of your client, by adding [is-file] child node beneath your parameter node, and set its value to 'true'. Below is
